pest or pathogen have a temperature at which it cannot survive?
(TRUE or FALSE)}

minimum temperature}

temperature related mortality occurs for your pest or pathogen (-50 and 60)}

related mortality occurs for your pest or pathogen integer value between 1
and 12}

Needs to be a list of files the same length as treatment_dates and
pesticide_duration.}

\item{treatment_method}{what method to use when applying treatment one of
("ratio" or "all infected"). ratio removes a portion of all infected and
susceptibles, all infected removes all infected a portion of susceptibles.}

\item{natural_kernel_type}{what type of dispersal kernel should be used for
natural dispersal can be ('cauchy', 'exponential')}

\item{anthropogenic_kernel_type}{what type of dispersal kernel should be
used for anthropogenic dispersal can be ('cauchy', 'exponential')}

usually due to wind values ('N', 'NW', 'W', 'SW', 'S', 'SE', 'E', 'NE',
'NONE')}

dispersal usually due to human movement typically over long distances (e.g.
nursery trade, movement of firewood, etc..) ('N', 'NW', 'W', 'SW', 'S',

is a culling (i.e. host removal) not a pesticide treatment. (needs to be the
 same length as treatment_dates and treatment_file)}

\description{
A dynamic species distribution model for pest or pathogen spread in forest
or agricultural ecosystems. The model is process based meaning that it uses
understanding of the effect of weather and other environmental factors on
reproduction and survival of the pest/pathogen in order to forecast spread
of the pest/pathogen into the future. Run multiple stochasitic simulations,
propogating uncertainty in parameters, initial conditions, and drivers.
