\item{lethal_temperature}{the temperature in degrees C at which lethal temperature related mortality occurs for your pest or pathogen (-50 and 60)}

\item{lethal_temperature_month}{the month in which lethal temperature related mortality occurs for your pest or pathogen integer value between 1 and 12}

\item{infected}{matrix of infected hosts}

\item{exposed}{vector of matrices of the exposed class for use with "SEI" model type}

\item{pesticide_duration}{how long does the pestcide (herbicide, vaccine, etc..) last before the host is susceptible again. If value is 0 treatment is a culling (i.e. host removal) not a pesticide treatment. (needs to be the same length as treatment_dates and treatment_file)}

\item{resistant}{matrix to track resistant population over time}

\item{use_movements}{this is a boolean to turn on use of the movement module.}

\item{natural_kernel_type}{what type of dispersal kernel should be used for natural dispersal can be ('cauchy', 'exponential')}

\item{anthropogenic_kernel_type}{what type of dispersal kernel should be used for anthropogenic dispersal can be ('cauchy', 'exponential')}

\item{use_anthropogenic_kernel}{A boolean that turns on the use of the anthropogenic or long distance dispersal portion of the 2 scale dispersal kernel function}

\item{model_type_}{What type of model most represents your sysetm. Options are "SEI" (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected/Infested) or "SI" (Susceptible - Infected/Infested). Default value is "SI".}

\item{latency_period}{How many times steps does it take to for exposed populations become infected/infested. This is an integer value and must be greater than 0 if model type is SEI.}
