\description{
Wrapper for pops_model_cpp. A dynamic species distribution model
for pest or pathogen spread in forest or agricultural ecosystems. The model
is process based meaning that it uses understanding of the effect of weather
and other environmental factors on reproduction and survival of the
pest/pathogen in order to forecast spread of the pest/pathogen into the
future.
