\description{
Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation is used to estimate the reproductive rate and the short distance scale parameters. Model 
accuracy is gauged using a custom quantity allocation disagreement function to assess accuracy of spatial configuration. The 
calibration uses this metric to determine if an MCMC run is kept either because it improves the results or randomly gets kept 
despite being worse. We recommend running calibration for at least 10,000 iterations but even more will provide a better result. 
If the model converges and doesn't improve for awhile it will exist calibration prior to reaching the total number of iterations specified.
