\description{
Either Approximate Bayesian Computation or Markov Chain Monte Carlo
Approximation is used to estimate relevant model parameters. Model accuracy
is gauged using a custom quantity allocation disagreement function to assess
accuracy of spatial configuration. We test number of predictions, number of
predicted locations, cumulative distance to nearest infection. The
calibration uses these metrics to determine if a run is kept if it is under
a threshold. either because it improves the results or randomly gets kept
despite being worse. We recommend running calibration for at least 10,000
iterations but even more will provide a better result. If the model converges
and doesn't improve for awhile it will exist calibration prior to reaching
the total number of iterations specified.
