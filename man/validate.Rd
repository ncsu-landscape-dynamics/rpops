Needs to be a list of files the same length as treatment_dates and
pesticide_duration.}

("ratio" or "all infected"). ratio removes a portion of all infected and
susceptibles, all infected removes all infected a portion of susceptibles.}

natural dispersal. Current dispersal kernel options are
 ('cauchy', 'exponential', 'uniform', 'deterministic neighbor','power law',
 'hyperbolic secant', 'gamma', 'weibull',

usually due to wind values ('N', 'NW', 'W', 'SW', 'S', 'SE', 'E', 'NE',

\description{
This function uses the quantity, allocation, and configuration disagreement
to validate the model across the landscape using the parameters from the
calibrate function. Ideally the model is calibrated with 2 or more years of
data and validated for the last year or if you have 6 or more years of data
then the model can be validated for the final 2 years.
