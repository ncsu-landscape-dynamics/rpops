\description{
This function uses the quantity, allocation, and configuration disagreement
to validate the model across the landscape using the parameters from the
calibrate function. Ideally the model is calibrated with 2 or more years of
data and validated for the last year or if you have 6 or more years of data
then the model can be validated for the final 2 years.
