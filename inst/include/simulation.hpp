/*! A class to control the spread simulation.
 *
 * \deprecated
 * The class is deprecated in favor of individual action classes and a higher-level
 * Model. The class corresponding to the original Simulation class before too much code
 * accumulated in Simulation is SpreadAction. The class is now used only in tests.
 *
 * The Simulation class handles the mechanics of the model, but the
 * timing of the events or steps should be handled outside of this
 * class unless noted otherwise. The notable exceptions are exposed
 * hosts in the SEI model type and mortality.
 *
 * The template parameters IntegerRaster and FloatRaster are raster
 * image or matrix types. Any 2D numerical array should work as long as
 * it uses function call operator to access the values, i.e. it provides
 * indexing for reading and writing values using `()`. In other words,
 * the operations such as the two following ones should be possible:
 *
 * ```
 * a(i, j) = 1;
 * a(i, j) == 1;
 * ```
 *
 * The PoPS library offers a Raster template class to fill this role,
 * but other classes can be used as well.
 *
 * Template parameter RasterIndex is type used for maximum indices of
 * the used rasters and should be the same as what the actual raster
 * types are using. However, at the same time, comparison with signed
 * type are performed and a signed type might be required in the future.
 * A default is provided, but it can be changed in the future.

     * the number of pests (groups of pest) in a raster cell.
     *
     * The movement happens in two stages. First, all the leaving pests are identified
     * and removed from the source cells. Second, the move to the target cells is
     * performed. This means that even if the resulting number of pests in the target
     * cell is considered too high, it is left as is and the move is performed the next
     * time this function is called.
     *
     * If the pests (pest population) cannot be accommodated in the target cell due to
     * the insufficient number of susceptible hosts, the excessive pests die.
     *
     * @param[in,out] susceptible Susceptible hosts
     * @param[in,out] infected Infected hosts
     * @param total_hosts All host individuals in the area. Is equal to
     * infected + exposed + susceptible in the cell.
     * @param[in,out] outside_dispersers Dispersers escaping the rasters
     * @param dispersal_kernel Dispersal kernel to move dispersers (pests)
     * @param[in] suitable_cells List of indices of cells with hosts

     *        considered to be overpopulated
