     *
     * Applicable to SEI model, no-operation otherwise, i.e., the state
     * is left intact for SI.
     *
     * Before the first latency period is over,
     * the E to I transition won't happen because no item in the exposed
     * vector is old enough to become infected.
     *
     * The position of the items in the exposed vector determines their
     * age, i.e., for how long the hosts are exposed. The oldest item
     * is at the front and youngest at the end.
     * Before the the first latency period is over, items in the front
     * are still empty (unused) because no hosts were exposed for the
     * given time period.
     * After the first latency
     * period, this needs to be true before the function is called and
     * it is true after the function
     * finished with the difference that after the function is called,
     * the last item is empty in the sense that it does not contain any
     * hosts.
     *
     * When the E to I transition happens, hosts from the oldest item
     * in the exposed vector are moved to the infected (and mortality
     * tracker). They are removed from the exposed item and this item
     * is moved to the back of the vector.
     *
     * Like in disperse(), there is no distinction between *infected*
     * and *mortality_tracker*, but different usage is expected outside
     * of this function.
     *
     * The raster class used with the simulation class needs to support
     * `.fill(value)` method for this function to work.
     *
     * Step is used to evaluate the latency period.
