## Overview

This is the R package for simulating spread of pests and pathogens. The package is an R package with multiple functions built around the PoPS (Pest or Pathogen Spread) model implemented in the C++ library maintained in the [PoPS Core Repository](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/pops-core). 

PoPs is a stochastic spread model of pests and pathogens in forest and agricultural landscapes to learn more visit [popsmodel.org](https://popsmodel.org/). The R package provides an easy way for researchers to calibrate, validate, and test what if scenarios of treatment interventions. The model is also available in GRASS GIS you can install and use [r.pops.spread](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/r.pops.spread) to run the model in GRASS GIS.

you are using for example:

## How to install

Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if not already installed. Once Rtools is installed you can the latest version of PoPS by 
running the code below and changing the ref to match the latest semantic version
or the specific version that you are looking to install. PoPS requires [terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra) version 1.1-7 or higher which isn't on the CRAN yet.
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rspatial/terra")
devtools::install_github("ncsu-landscape-dynamics/rpops", ref = "v1.0.2")
library(PoPS)

```
