## Overview

This is the R package for simulating spread of pests and pathogens. The package is an R package with multiple functions built around the PoPS (Pest or Pathogen Spread) model implemented in the C++ library maintained in the [PoPS Core Repository](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/pops-core). 

PoPs is a stochastic spread model of pests and pathogens in forest and agricultural landscapes to learn more visit [popsmodel.org](https://popsmodel.org/). The R package provides an easy way for researchers to calibrate, validate, and test what if scenarios of treatment interventions. The model is also available in GRASS GIS you can install and use [r.pops.spread](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/r.pops.spread) to run the model in GRASS GIS.

## Features
the PoPS package in R is built on top of PoPS Core C++ library includes:

* Susceptible-infected (`SI`) and susceptible-exposed-infected (`SEI`) model types (`model_type`, `latency_period`).
* Host mortality tracking (`mortality_rate`, `mortality_time_lag`, `mortality`).
* Host removal and pesticide application treatments (`treatments`, `treatment_date`, `pesticide_duration`).
* Host resistance based on pesticide application treatments (`pesticide_duration` > 0).
* Treatments applied only to a ratio of hosts (`treatment_application`).
* Yearly pest removal based on lethal temperature (`lethal_temperature`, `lethal_month`).
* Two different dispersal kernels (`natural_dispersal_kernel`, `anthropogenic_dispersal_kernel`).
* Cauchy, Exponential, Uniform, Power-law, Deterministic neighbor, Hyperbolic-Secant, Gamma, Weibull, Normal, and Logistic radial dispersal kernels use Von Mises distribution.
* Seasonal spread (`seasonality` in months).
* Host movement for animals moving from farm to farm or plants via nursery trade (`use_movements`, `movements_file`).
* Reduced stochasticity options (`generate_stochasticity`, `establishment_stochasticity`, `movement_stochasticity`) and deterministic versions of kernels (`deterministic`) other required parameters if reducing stochasticity are (`dispersal_percentage`, `establishment_probability`).
* Spread rate measurement in 4 cardinal directions (`west_rate`, `east_rate`, `south_rate`, `north_rate`) when (`use_spreadrates`) is true.
* Distance to quarantine in 4 cardinal directions (`north_distance_to_quarantine`, `south_distance_to_quarantine`, `east_distance_to_quarantine`, `west_distance_to_quarantine`) when (`use_quarantine`) is true and (`quarantine_areas_file`) is provided.
* Probability of quarantine escape (`escape_probability`).
* Overpopulation function (individuals in areas of high population leave the area and disperse longer distances on average) (`use_overpopulation`, `overpopulation_percentage`, `leaving_percentage`, `leaving_scale_coefficient`).
* Flexible output frequency with n number of days, weeks, months, or years as options (`output_frequency`, `output_frequency_n`).

### Functions in rpops
* `calibrate:` Calibration of the model parameters using either MCMC (markov chain monte carlo) or ABC (approximate bayesian computation). 
* `validate:` Validation of the model using quantiy, allocation, and configuration disagreement.
* `pops_multirun:` Parallel execution of multiple stochastic runs (`number_of_cores` used to set cores used if left NULL defaults to using n - 1 cores on the machine). Outputs statistics of infected/infested hosts across multiple runs (`simulation_mean`,  `single_run`,  `simulation_sd`, `simulation_min`, `simulation_max`), current state using the median (`infected`,  `exposed`, and `susceptible`), average and standard deviations whole area statistics (`number_infecteds`, `infected_areas`), and probability of infection (`probability`) which is the percent of model runs that a cell has at least one infestation/infection.
* `pops:` Runs a single stochastic run of the model. This function is primarily used for automated testing of model functionality.

## How to install

Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if not already installed. Once Rtools is installed you can the latest version of PoPS by 
running the code below and changing the ref to match the latest semantic version
or the specific version that you are looking to install. PoPS requires [terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra) version 1.1-17 or higher.

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ncsu-landscape-dynamics/rpops", ref = "v1.0.2")
library(PoPS)

```
